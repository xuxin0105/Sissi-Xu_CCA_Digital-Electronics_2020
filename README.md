Digital Electronics HW&amp;Exercise

## Week 4
- Step one: This week, I learned how to connect Arduino with the LCD and display the words I wanted on the LCD screen.
- Next Step: Learn the color sensor and able to recognized its RGB values and then printed on the LCD screen.

## Week 3
- My design concept is based on the story that happened around me. I bet some times in your life want to have to eat a certain flavor of candy, but because mentos multi-flavor is a tube, you can not choose the order in which flavor of the candy appears, so what should you do when you only want grape flavor candy.

- Electric M

- Code: My code will transmit the color recognized by the sensor to the motor so that it can change the direction correctly and accurately to drop the candy into the correct container.

- First Step: Sketch out the machine and use cardboard to make a prototype.
- Second Step: Refine the Prototype using better materials.
- Final Step: Refine again to be well accomplished.
- Add on: "Nice to have"

- "Must have"
  - The TCS3200 color sensor. (Sense and recognize the color of the candy)
  - Able to separate colored candies into different container.
  
- "Nice to have"
  - Different colors of led represent different colors of candy.
  - Digital Counter
   
- Research on Sensors:
  - The TCS3200 color sensor: https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-color-sensing-tutorial-tcs230-tcs3200-color-sensor/
  - Touch Sensor: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1375
  - 1x4 Keypad: https://www.adafruit.com/product/1332
  - These three sensors I had most interesting by its use, I will try to include in my midterm project. The color sensor sensed the color and separated them, and then transmitted the information into the computer and output to use to control any product on their motion. The touch sensor can be used in a touchpad to turn on and off the switch for a device or powerful a machine. 1*4 ket pad each button can use as a single switch to program and control different outputs.
  
## Week 2
- I found this video, which I feel it's interesting. It is An Arduino-powered Egg Printer that made from the ELEKS team. This machine can print the digital graphic on the surface of the egg, and it controls the direction of the pen to draw the design figure along the curve of the egg smoothly. You end up with a specially designed egg. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9fdly5wphA
